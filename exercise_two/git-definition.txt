## From Wikipedia:

*Git* (/ɡɪt/[6]) is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development,[7] but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed,[8] data integrity,[9] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[10]
